# CSS Animations

In all the years I've been a frontend developer, I've never had the opportunity to work with or on CSS animations or transitions. This little repo will be home to my experiments. 

## Resources I'm using

* MDN web docs:
   - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation
   - [Using CSS transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions#Which_CSS_properties_are_animatable)
