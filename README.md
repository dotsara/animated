# CSS Animations

In all the years I've been a frontend developer, I've never had the opportunity to work with or on CSS animations or transitions. This little repo will be home to my experiments. 

## Experiments

1. [Sliding a ball back and forth in a container](01-getting-started/back-and-forth.html)
   Just like it says on the tin. I definitely got stuck for a second until I noticed the example I was using specified `paused`. Oy.
1. [Sliding a ball up and down in a container](01-getting-started/up-and-down.html)
   Again: not complicated, although the behavior isn't precisely waht I expected. Something to work on.
